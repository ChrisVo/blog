Hi!

My name is Chris. I’m a software developer from Southern California. Currently, I work for an electric vehicle company doing DevOps stuff.

I’m interested in automating things in the cloud ☁️, Rust 🦀, and all things tech.

I plan on using this blog as a way to record what I learn and other information. If you’re looking to learn something, you’ve come to the wrong page.
